By talking to the Union Room npc, a Map Id and coordinate check is performed. If it matches, it overwrites data at [base] + 1488 with those values.
 
It will then warp you to them if you would reset the console. But since the check fails (we are at a wrong Y value) we will warp to our earlier written Explorer kit values at [Base] + 1488.
X = FFE1
Y = 0000
 
Since Explorer Kit is used in an Outdoor map
Matrix id 1x1 => 30x30
 
X ram change (65505/32*2) = 4094 = 0FFE
Y ram change (0/32*2*30) = 0 = 0000
 
We add 0FFE to [base] + 22ADA.
This puts us at [base] + 23AD8.
This us really close to warp coordinates, sprite coordinates, sprite Id's, events, flagdata,... which we will now abuse heavily.

When we pressed RETIRE we activated a cutscene that stores our

X = 0000 00FB but is written as 16 bit => 00FB
Y = FFFF FFC1 but is written as 16 bit => FFC1
 
And warps us back to the void of spear pillar and 16 bit equivalent of the coordinates. This does the following
 
X ram change: (251/32*2) = 14 = 000E
Y ram change: (65217/32*2*2) =  8152 = 1FD8
 
We add 1FE6 to [base] + 22ADA.
This puts us at [base] + 24AC0.
This is really close to coordinate, warp, animation, sprite... data. (the thing is a mess)
We will be abusing coordinates, and warpdata.
